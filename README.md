A rust inspired maybe and result library.

## Introduction

The `Maybe` type represents an
optional value that can either be `Some` when it contains a value or `None` if
it does not.

The `Result` type closely resembles the type of the same name from rust. It adds
a way to describe a possible error instead of the absence of a value.

Both are typed and generic so they can be used both safely and for different
use-cases.
